<!--
### Why not chdb?
> chdb was a great promise and we contributed to its inception and its bindings from the very beginning.<br>
> sadly it has been _"sold"_ by its main author to ClickHouse Inc. and is now controlled by a corporation.<br>
> This fork builds on the same technology stack without politics, redtape or hidden comemrcial interests.<br>

_Cows are peaceful and produce milk. Snakes bite with poison._
